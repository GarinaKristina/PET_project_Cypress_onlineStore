Hi!
This is my pet project dedicated framework Cypress, here I wrote some automation tests for the online store H&M.
Also, I implemented patterns such as PageObject with PageComponents.
Here I used Mocha + Chai Assertions.
Additionally, this framework saved results in screenshots and videos.

Basically, in the framework, you can only work with selectors, for convenience, I installed an additional plagin "cypress-xpath", it mean now I can use xpath locators too.

The reporter in this project "cypress-mochawesome-reporter", after running tests report auto-generates an HTML file and you can easily see all results.
